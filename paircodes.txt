# Pair code: numbers are ERs and letters are EEs
1_a
1_b
1_c
1_d
1_e

### Example: 14_c ===> ER no: 14, third EE.

# Above is extended by one of the camera codes below

_sr # shoulder cam facing ER
_se # shoulder cam facing EE

_mr # facecam facing ER
_me # facecam facing EE

_to # topview cam
_si # side cam

### Example: 9_b_mr ===> ER no: 9, second EE, facacam facing the ER

# Recall tasks
### both will watch the video recorded by the side cam
### so only pair code plus a code for recall participant is enough

_rr # ER's recall
_re # EE's recall

###  Example 4_e_re ===> ER no: 4, fifth EE, EE's recall

# Sound file
### We will get two sound files I think
### So pair code plus whose voice is the dominant voice 

_vr # ER's
_ve # EE's

### Example 17_d_vr ER no: 17, fourth EE, ER's voice
